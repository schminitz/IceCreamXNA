This code is free to modify and use in any capacity EXCEPT to make an engine/editor spinoff. That is, you can package and sell a game that uses the engine, but not the engine stand-alone, and you can't claim you created the engine.

If an existing license meets this condition, please let me know so I can standardize this!
